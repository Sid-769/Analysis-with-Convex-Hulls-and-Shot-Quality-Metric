# Analysis-with-Convex-Hulls-and-Shot-Quality-Metric
Visualizing soccer player performance using Convex Hulls and an advanced Shot Quality metric for nuanced shot analysis

Description:
In the dynamic world of soccer analytics, evaluating player performance, especially shot-taking ability, has become more intricate than ever. This project takes a deep dive into player shot data to provide a comprehensive visual representation of shot locations on the soccer field. By utilizing Convex Hulls, we encircle the regions of the field from where players have taken shots, offering a visual emphasis on their preferred zones.

Moreover, while traditional metrics like 'Shots on Target' and 'Expected Goals (xG)' have their place, this project introduces the Shot Quality metric. This novel metric assesses the quality of shots based on various underpinning factors, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of a player's shooting prowess.

Interestingly, the concept of the Shot Quality metric isn't entirely new to our studies. In a previous project, we touched upon this metric, outlining its potential importance in the soccer analytics landscape. With this endeavor, we've delved deeper into its intricacies and practical applications.

Features:
Convex Hull Visualization: Graphically determine and illustrate the region on the soccer field where a player is most likely to take shots.
Shot Quality Metric: A custom statistic developed to gauge the quality of shots taken by players, offering a blend of traditional metrics for a more detailed insight.
Pitch Representation: A meticulously crafted half-pitch representation to display the Convex Hull and relevant player statistics.
Interactivity: Easily change between players to see individual shot data, Convex Hulls, and the Shot Quality metric.
Potential Use Cases:
Team Coaches & Management: Gain insights into where players most frequently shoot from and the quality of these shots to inform tactical decisions.
Players: Understand personal strengths and areas for improvement in shooting.
Fans & Analysts: A visually appealing and informative tool to discuss and debate player performance.
Technical Details:
The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as Matplotlib for visualization, SciPy for Convex Hull calculations, and pandas for data handling.
